Well...

Things are working out very well here.  Lots of major advancements going on
in figuring out just how Allen Bradley has things working.  Also getting
lots of people testing on many different platforms.  All is well, except...

I am currently looking for a place to host this project.  All I need is an
FTP account that is both publically accessable (anonymous) and capable of
allowing me to log in and send files (full write access).  I don't need much
space or bandwidth - the project isn't exactly the Gnome ya know.  I have
looked and looked with much luck.  Before someone asks: Yes, I did try
SourceForge.net.  They don't have ftp logins...  I will be dumping them as
soon as I find an FTP site I can do this project from.

Anyhow, that is what I am looking for, an ftp host for this project.  I will
keep the web page for the project at my ISP (att.net).  The amount of
traffic generated by this project will be miniscule.

Please let me know if you can help!

Thanks!
