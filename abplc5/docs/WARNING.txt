Hi folks!

Since yoe are even contemplating using this program, certain things about
you and your operation are assumed at this point:

You are intimately familiar with the liability you are taking on your own
accord.  Industrial machinery and other equipment that can be controlled by
an Allen Bradley PLC can be extremely dangerous.  It is not uncommon for
this machinery to be capable of severely injuring OR KILLING people.  Yes,
that is right, KILLING! 

If you were not already aware of this, please follow these instructions
immediately...
Delete This Program at once.
Stop whatever you were doing (or planning to do)
Change your career immediately before you kill someone.

However, because there are still some idiots in this world who remain
clueless, I must state the following:

THIS PROGRAM IS CAPABLE OF MODIFYING THE INTERNAL CONTENTS OF THE DATA TABLE
OF A PLC.  THAT CAN CAUSE YOUR MACHINERY TO ACTIVATE OR OTHERWISE OPERATE IN
AN UNPREDICTABLE AND/OR DANGEROUS MANNER.  IT IS ENTIRELY YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE CERTAIN THAT THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT CAUSE YOUR MACHINERY
TO OPERATE IN AN UNSAFE MANNER.  I CAN NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM
AND/OR DAMAGE THAT YOUR USE OF THIS PROGRAM CREATES.
