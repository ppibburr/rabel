v0.0.1 - initial release
	Contained abread and clread.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.2 - 11-18-99
	Removed ControlLogix support due to AB's using a vastly
	different protocol for Ethernet communications on the
	ControlLogix PLC called CIP.  This support is expected to
	be added in at a later date (as soon as I get documentation
	of the CIP protocol as AB uses it and a ControlLogix PLC
	to test out my code on).

	Fixed connection number to use 3 bytes instead of 1.

	Added abstat program

	Added abwrite program

	Changed addressing method to use AB's binary addressing model.
	This allows us to access the .acc and .pre words of timers
	and counters.  However, using this addressing model breaks
	Pyramid support (for now).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.9 - 12-21-99
	Major rework of entire project.  Converted all relevent
	code into a library.  Rewrote the abread and abwrite utilities
	to use this new library.

	Made several changes to the structures used for communications.
	These changes rely on a #PRAGMA pack 1 working in your
	environment.  If you are running Linux, you shouldn't have
	any problems.  I don't know about any other environment - yet.
	For those that don't know, #PRAGMA pack 1 basically removes
	any byte padding between elements of a structure.

	This code is the first time I have released untested code. 
	For an explaination, please refer to the HELPME.PLEASE file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.0 - 12-23-99
	Fixed byte order of Connection ID used in the library routines.

	Fixed some packet lengths (sending too much data).

	Got abstat.c converted to use the library.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.1 - 1-13-00 
	Added UploadReq - prepares PLC for uploading (sending) the
	program.  Returns the memory segments that are uploadable.

	Added UploadDone - exits Upload mode on the PLC.

	Added SetPLCMode - Allows switching PLC between Remote Program,
	Remote Test, and Remote Run modes.

	Bugfix: getstatus.c was not reporting PLC Revision level correctly.

	Implemented changes to Makefile to allow compilation on HP/UX v10.2
		Thanks to Stan Brown (stanb@awod.com) for the fix.

	Bugfix: nameconv5.c was not handling addresses larger than 255
		correctly.  Thanks to Stan Brown (stanb@awod.com) for
		finding this one.

	Added ReadBytesPhysical - reads raw memory locations from the PLC
		used for Uploading the program from the PLC

	Make Install has been removed until the project is finished -
		especially since it was never made to work correctly 
		in the first place.

	Bugfix: nameconv5.c was not encoding Input and Output addresses
		correctly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.2 - 1-19-00
	Fixed compiler warnings in abupload.c

	Finished implementation of plcsetmode.  Includes sample program
		absetmode to allow remote changing of plc run mode.

		*IMPORTANT* before changing PLC modes on a live machine,
		MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that it is safe to do so.  Changing
		run modes on a machine can be extremely dangerous,
		especially if the machine has people in or near it. 	

	Added stress, program to constantly read data from a PLC.  Used to
		show the robustness of the code (and for limitation testing
		of the PLC regarding constant data polling).  This program
		uses the same syntax as abread.  Use <ctrl><c> to stop it.

	Bugfix: Thanks to Mike Ayers and Joe Dial of Siemens Automotive
		(mike.ayers@at.siemens.com) and Stan Brown (stanb@awon.com),
		I was able to isolate and fix the bug that would prevent 
		connections after lots of connects and disconnects.  It
		would also prevent you from connecting more than one
		instance.  This is not a guarenteed fix as there is still
		a possible byte alignment problem.  Please test/beat up on
		this as much as you can.  If it breaks for you still, then 
		please try swapping 'conn' and 'b2' in the Ethernet_Header
		structure in the libabplc5.h file.  In other words
		(existing)
		...
		byte b2;
		unsigned long conn;
		...

		(change to if needed)
		unsigned long conn;
		byte b2;
		...
		If you need help with this, e-mail me and let me know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.3 - 1-22-00

	Bugfix: Thanks to a friend in a convenient place (who wishes to remain
		anonymous), I have finally fixed the ethernet header
		problems.  This fix IS authoratative.
	
	Fixed all the library functions to use the new header layout.

	Added floating point support.  Changed abread and abwrite to support
		writing to the floating point register(s).  Refer to either
		of these programs for examples on how to code floating point
		support into your programs.

	Added experimental support for Pyramid Integrator addressing.
		I have no access to a PI so I have no idea if
		this works or not.

	Changed format of the _data struct to accomidate getting floating
		point data work accurately.  There were rounding problems
		that showed up due to the struct defining data as signed.
		This means that any program that uses wordblockread should
		now make sure to cast the data member back to (short) to
		restore the sign.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.4 - 2-6-00

	Added SLC and Pyramid support to getstatus.c and abstat.  

	Added SLC addressing support to nameconv5.c.  This is to 
		accomidate the addition of the 3-address read/write
		functions that are SLC specific.

	Added Porting document to show what environments my code works on.

	Added docs subdirectory where all documentation will go.

	Moved all relevent docs into new docs subdirectory.

	Added versioning to the archive file name.  Also added AWK
		scripts to assist in keeping version numbers
		straight.

	Removed make target 'dist' and replaced with targets "beta",
		"release", and "major".  This is to facilitate keeping
		the releases straight.

	Fixed bugs in nameconv5.c relating to PI addressing.

	Added Undocumented_df1 text file to describe what I am finding
		that Allen Bradley was kind enough to not publish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.5 - 02/13/00

	More bug fixes in nameconv5.c

	Typed Read now works.  Note that the way this command works is
		completely different than what is documented in the
		DF1 spec book.

	Switched abread.c to use the typed read.  This gives us SLC
		support for reading the data table.

	Added more entries and some data into the undocumented_df1 file

	Added an undoc_file_struct document that relates to how the
		memory areas are set up on the PLC5.

	Cleaned up the docs directory.

	Added getedit routine - gets edit resource.

	Added dropedit routine - releases edit resource.

	Added resetmemory routine - clears ALL memory in PLC.

	Added creatememory routine - used to create an address in the data
		table.

	Added readsectionsize routine - reports back how many "elements"
		each area of memory use.

	Restructured nameconv5.c to allow (many) more data typed to be
		encoded.  This includes being able to encode for reading/
		writing rung data, force table data, and so on.  Read the
		Readme file for more information.

	Added a program called section that will report the size of each
		section of memory.  This is useful eventually for a PLC
		upload routine that works!  It also can indicate the size
		of the current PLC program (look at Section 1's numbers).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.6 - 02/20/00

	Added protected_read/write_3 commands (for the SLC)

	Added protected_read/write_2 commands (for the SLC)

	Added protected_write_4 command (for the SLC)

	Added SLC specific read/write example programs.

	Changed abread and abwrite to abtypedread and abtypedwrite.

	Added abwordread and abwordwrite example programs.

	Rewrote Floating Point stuff to make it much more resiliant.

	Rewrote the Makefile in ./src to make addition/deletion of example
		programs much easier to deal with.

	Added more "undocumented" commands to the list in ./docs

	Fixed several segfault errors caused by copying too much data.

	Renamed all text files in the ./docs directory to the extension .txt	
	This should make this directory much more "friendly" towards our
	Win32 based friends - Hi Lynn!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.7 - 3/12/00

	Added shared lib creation.  

	Added installing the library to /usr/local/lib during make.

	Added the following routines:
		senddf1, downloaddone, downloadreq, enableforces,
		disableforces, closefile, echo, fileread, filewrite,
		and openfile.
